##A Working Example With Rails (Part 4 of 4)
######Thanks to http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html

####Goals
Look through and see a working app that can create, edit, update, and destroy 
(CRUD) items in a todo list

####NOTE: in order to run this final version without completing prior steps:

(i.e. if you have git cloned this repository and want to see how it works 
but haven't followed along creating a new project with the tutorial)

   $ bundle install  
   
   $ rake db:migrate  
   
   $ rails server -b 0.0.0.0 -p 8080  

*Changes from prior steps:*
####Step 1: edit
  * Edits to app/controllers/items_controller.rb  
  * Edits to app/views/items/edit.html.erb (creates this file as well)  
  * Edits to app/views/items/index.html.erb  

####Step 2: destroy

  * Edits to app/controllers/items_controller.rb   
  * Edits to app/views/items/index.html.erb
