## A Working Example With Rails (Part 4 of 4)
###### Thanks to http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html

#### Goals
Look through and see a working app that can create, edit, update, and destroy 
(CRUD) items in a todo list

#### NOTE: in order to run this final version without completing prior steps:

(i.e. if you have git cloned this repository and want to see how it works 
but haven't followed along creating a new project with the tutorial)

   `$ bundle install`  
   
   `$ rake db:migrate`  
   
   `$ rails server -b 0.0.0.0 -p 8080`  

*Changes from prior steps:*
#### Step 1: edit
  * Edits to app/controllers/items_controller.rb  
  * Edits to app/views/items/edit.html.erb (creates this file as well)  
  * Edits to app/views/items/index.html.erb  

#### Step 2: destroy

  * Edits to app/controllers/items_controller.rb   
  * Edits to app/views/items/index.html.erb
